1) I get happy whenever I see my girlfriend.



2) I hate how stupid people can be sometimes.



3) I hate loving you this much.



4) This is big time, feels like we are witnessing history.

Found myself consistently stunned, not so much by the enormity of the physical, but by its ability to amplify the intimate. There’s a moment in the movie, where a switch is flipped and Paul begins to embrace the fanaticism and that’s when I knew I was watching something special. Also the sandworm scene.

When does loyalty shift into worship? Like a line drawn in sand, it exists as we stare at it, but once we look away, it becomes indistinguishable. 



5) The afternoon tea service at the Plaza is absolutely delightful. The atmosphere and service are both divine. We so appreciate Kazi J and the rest of the team for making our afternoon truly special. Thank you so much and we will most certainly be back!
